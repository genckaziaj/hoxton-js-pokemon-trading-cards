Description
We're going to create a Pokemon Trading Cards show page. To achieve this, you'll use JS to dynamically create all the elements on the page!

Instructions
- Use this template as the starting point => https://codesandbox.io/s/pokemon-trading-cards-template-rd5vq?file=/index.js
- Make sure you check and understand the data that is given to you! 
- Create a card using JS that represents a single pokemon, use the example image as a reference. You will also find an HTML example in the templates folder
- Use the exact CSS classes you see in the example HTML to obtain the same style for each card
- The cards should be nested inside <ul class="cards"></ul>. Otherwise the styles will break.
- Use the official-artwork object key as the images for the cards. The images are all inside of the sprites key, in each pokemon object
- Render all the cards on the page that represents all the pokemons, recreating the same layout, using JS

Tips
- Use functions to your advantage. Break each card into smaller parts, and think how you can turn them into functions.
- Once you've got a card, think of a way to programmatically create all the others
- Make sure you understand well the data structure before starting to create the cards
